## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Controllers**
   - Enhanced `LoanApplicationController.php` with calculator and application submission logic

2. **Views**
   - Updated `resources/views/loan/application.blade.php` with modern UI elements and calculator

3. **Assets**
   - Created `public/css/loan-application.css` for custom styling

4. **Routes**
   - Added new routes in `routes/web.php` for the loan application page and API endpoints

5. **Testing**
   - Added `test_loan_application.sh` script to verify the implementation

### Routes

The following routes were implemented:

- `GET /loan/application` - Display the loan application page with calculator
- `POST /loan/calculate-emi` - API endpoint for EMI calculations
- `POST /loan/submit-application` - Process the loan application submission

### Permission Fix

The implementation includes fixes for the permission issues with loan types not showing for test users:

1. The loan type query now properly uses the parent_id parameter with proper permissions
2. All active loan types are loaded and made available to the calculator
3. Improved error handling and validation for loan application submission

## Usage

1. Visit the loan application page at `https://fix.mbcfinserv.com/loan/application`
2. Use the calculator to determine suitable loan amount and term
3. Complete the application form with required documents
4. Submit the application for processing

## Testing

Run the provided test script to verify the implementation:

```bash
./test_loan_application.sh
```

This script checks if:
- Loan types are visible to test users
- The calculator is functioning properly
- The application form is loading correctly

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Add support for more complex interest calculation methods
2. Implement a progress tracker for loan application status
3. Add a comparison tool for different loan types
4. Integrate with credit score APIs for instant pre-approval
