# Loan Page Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing CSS Button Classes
**Problem**: The HTML was using button classes (`.btn-apply`, `.btn-explore`, etc.) that didn't exist in the CSS file.
**Solution**: Added all missing button classes to `public/css/modern-loans.css`:
- `.btn-apply` - Orange "Apply Now" buttons
- `.btn-explore` - Blue "Explore" buttons  
- `.btn-contact` - Green "Contact Support" buttons
- `.btn-apply-calculator` - Orange calculator apply buttons
- `.btn-view` - Blue "View" buttons for applications

### 2. ✅ View Compilation Error Fixed
**Problem**: `Call to a member function getName() on null` error in `resources/views/admin/menu.blade.php`
**Solution**: Added null check before calling `getName()`:
```php
$routeName = \Request::route() ? \Request::route()->getName() : null;
```

### 3. ✅ JavaScript Routing Fixed (Previously)
**Problem**: Apply buttons were routing to wrong URLs
**Solution**: Updated `applyNow()` function to use correct wizard URLs

### 4. ✅ CSS Layout Conflicts Addressed (Previously)  
**Problem**: Admin layout styles conflicting with modern loan interface
**Solution**: Added comprehensive CSS overrides to neutralize admin styles
